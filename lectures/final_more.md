# More and other things to know

This course's aim was to provide basic training and support for further skills courses in the Digital Humanities.

## Review

* Things we've covered: the command line, file paths, an assortment of useful commands, differences between operating systems
* More things we've covered: regular expressions, basically very complex search and pattern matching
* Things you now understand:
  * if a geek says \*, it means "everything"
  * if a geek says $job, it means "whatever job makes sense in context here"
* What was going on with that [[:digit:]] backreference
* How to grep for single quotes, dollar signs, etc.
* File formats and encodings:
  * Unicode
  * use UTF-8 without BOM
* GIT:
  * versioning and sharing
* [The Internet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDbyYGrswtg)
* How to make basic webpages:
  * HTML
  * CSS
  * JavaScript (JS)
  * Question about sorting tables: [see w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_sort_table.asp)
