# Teaching_CBS4DH
Teaching materials for AR Methodological Workshop - Computational Background Skills for Digital Humanities at University of Vienna.

## Course Information

Instructor: Tara L. Andrews<br>
Office hours: Monday 3–4pm (please appoint in advance)<br>
Attendance: Attendance is mandatory in all class sessions!

Course evaluation: The purpose of this course is to help you gain skills you will need for more advanced digital work, whether in the humanities or in any other field where you find yourself handling any sort of structured data. Since everyone has a different starting point, evaluation will be based primarily on how well you have demonstrated that you have tried to learn the material. Students will gain points for asking questions as well as answering them, and will lose points if they are found to be stuck and didn't ask for help. Review quizzes will be held at the beginning of sessions 3 and 6.

## Information (u:find)
### Aims, contents and method of the course
This course is intended to provide basic training and support for further skills courses in the Digital Humanities. It is strongly recommended as a prerequisite to the other DH practical courses.
As such, students will be required to bring a laptop computer (no tablets!) If this presents a problem, please contact one of the course instructors in advance.
- Introduction to the command line
- Introduction to file formats and filesystems
- Solving the mystery of special characters
- Understanding how the Internet works behind the browser
- Things you ought to know about your (Mac / Windows / Linux) operating system
- Where to go for help and how to understand the answers

### Assessment and permitted materials
Assessment will be on the basis of class participation, 'question' points, and intermittent quizzes.

## Exercise Guided Lecture Goals
We will try to accompany the contents of each course with some practical steps of the exercise, which will lead to a final project in the end.

The exercise goals of each lecture are:
- Day 1:
  - Install needed software to be used as terminal and code editor
  - Get familiar using the shell and code editor
  - Make a note of all the error and informational messages you encounter along the way
  - Change to your desktop directory and create a folder with empty README.md and index.html files for the project
- Day 2:
  - Begin to understand the mechanics of the shell and the environment
  - Practice getting information out of the error messages you have collected
- Day 3:
  - Apply learned RegEx methods to create the .csv file which will be used in the project
  - Download the exercise/lecture3/data.csv file and inspect it using the code editor
  - Practice getting information out of the error messages you have collected
- Day 4:
  - Make basic modifications the index.html and README.md files following the boilerplate code found in exercise/lecture3 folder
  - Create an empty repository on Github wit MIT Licence and push your project folder to remote (project folder should contain index.html, data.csv, README.md and LICENCE files)
  - Make requests of Web servers the same way that browsers do
  - Start, and use network protocols to interact with, a program on your own computer
- Day 5:
  - Modify the JavaScript function given in the boilerplate code to execute various regex tasks
  - See the output of regex by opening the index.html file with a browser
  - Understand how our code fetches the data using HTTP requests
  - Create HTML elements such as tables, divs, paragraphs etc. for our output
  - Add basic CSS styles for different elements
  - Add basic interaction elements e.g. buttons in HTML
  - Bind the elements to our JavaScript functions to toggle the data being displayed
  - Finalize the project, push it to git repo and make it online using GitHub Pages
- Day 6:
  - Write simple routines on the command line
  - Learn how to turn these routines into executable programs
  - Learn about different sorts of shells
  - Master the terminology that programmers take for granted
