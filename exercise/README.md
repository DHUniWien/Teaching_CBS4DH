# Exercise
The aim of this exercise is to accompany the contents of each course, connect the tasks and lead them to a final result.

As the data source the Historical Events data (http://www.vizgr.org/historical-events/) will be used and a part of it will be sliced to keep the size of the data set small: http://www.vizgr.org/historical-events/search.php?begin_date=10000000&end_date=12000000&format=json
